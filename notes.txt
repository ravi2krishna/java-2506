=======

    -> Non-Static Variables - individual copies for each object

    -> Static Variables - common copy for entire class

    -> Static Blocks - This is the block of code, that gets executed when the class is loaded into
        memory by JVM

        -> initialize the Static Variables, eveb before main method is executed

    -> Non-Static Blocks

    -> Non-Static Methods Cannot be called in Static Methods

    -> Static Methods Can be called in Non-Static Methods

    -> Inheritance - Obtaining the traits and characteristics from an existing
    class.
    
    -> According to our example, we want watchVideos() in multiple places
    will introduce Inheritance

    -> Types Of Inheritance

        -> Single
        -> Multiple  
        -> Multi Level
        -> Hirerarchial
        -> Hybrid

        -> NOTE: Java doesn't support multiple Inheritance with classes
        it supports with Interfaces 

    -> Single Inheritance
        -> Inherit features from single parent class
        -> child_class extends parent_class

    -> Multi Level Inheritance
        -> Inherit features from multi parent class
        -> child_class extends parent_class extends super_parent

    -> Multiple Inheritance
        -> Java doesn't support multiple Inheritance with classes
        -> Java supports multiple Inheritance with Interfaces
        -> Using Classes Extends failed with Multiple Inheritance
            -> class Admin extends Guest, VideoAdmin


        -> Interfaces - We have abstract methods i.e methods without 
        implementation
        
        -> Using Interfaces implments work with Multiple Inheritance
            -> class VideoAdmin implements Watchable, Addable

        -> Hirerarchial - Multiple classes inherit from same super class
            -> use extends to achieve

        -> Hybrid - Combination of single + mutiple / multilevel
